# Metabolite search in XCMS output

I have a few scripts in R for searching/plotting metabolites from XCMS output of Mass spectrometric
metabolomics data. They are pretty messy and basic. 

The basic code is for searching for specific metabolites based on high-resolution mass and retention time.
And plotting it for comparison between samples.

Some scripts are for separate cases, like search for in-source fragmentation (feature pairs) or 
database matching. 

I would like to rebuild them in Python with the tools learned in this course. 
Implement classes/modules/packages to optimize the use of searching/transforming/plotting algorithms.
Improve data analysis with numpy. Improve structure, readability, and documentation of the code.

I am planning to transfer all of it to python and continue to work with it. Let's see how far 
I can get it by the end of next week.
